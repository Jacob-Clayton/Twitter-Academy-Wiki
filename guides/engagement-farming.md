# ðŸšœ Engagement Farming

## What is engagement farming?

A strategy to create content that gets as much engagement as possible from other people. This usually gets archived by commenting on other people's tweets. (going to be updated)

## Why is it important?

To answer this question, you have to understand, what the goal of a website is.

Their goal is to hold people for as much time as possible on their site.

In Twitters case, the strategy they use to archive that is to suggest content to people, from people they have recently engaged with. Because if you engage with someone else's content, it's telling the algorithm, that you are interested in that person's content.

So why is this important? Because people spend on average more time with content from creators they have recently engaged with compared to random content from people they are following.&#x20;

Which means, if Twitter suggests content on peoples' timeline from others they have recently engaged with, they will end up spending more time on Twitter on average. Which then results in more ad revenue and growth for Twitter.

So replying to other people's tweets is basically the fuel, to get more engagement for your own account's tweets. Especially, if you do the same kind of tweets as the ones youve engaged with.

## How is the strategy being applied to grow an NFT Twitter account?

In the NFT Twitter space, many people, for example, tweet "GM" daily. So if you engage with their "GM"-tweets, you will end up getting for when you tweet "GM" yourself.

Note:

* Keep your "GM"-tweets very short, because most people who engage with "GM"-tweets are also engagement farming themselves and dont want to read long texts.
* Try to add pictures/memes to your "GM"-tweets to increase the engagement.

If you do that strategy aggressively, you should be able to get 50+ likes for your own "GM"-tweets after only 4â€“5 days of engagement farming.



The next step would be, to repeat the process with other kinds of tweets. For example with:

* "GN"-tweets
* memes

With that strategy alone, you will be able to grow your engagement for "GM"-tweets to up to \~1000 likes per tweet. Depending on how aggressively you are doing it.
